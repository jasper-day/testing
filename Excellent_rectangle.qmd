title: "Excellent Rectangle"
---

This excellent rectangle is a simple demonstration of Git's ability to perform version control on SOLIDWORKS parts.

The main downside that I can see to using Git (besides the fact that the entire repository is cloned onto your computer when you clone it, and that we could potentially run out of space if we host the repository on github) is that it may not recognize modifications to files, since it's not designed around storing raw (binary) data like .SLDPRT files.

The hole in the middle is designed to fit the [excellent pole](Excellent_pole.qmd) with 0.2 mm of clearance.

Here is the [stl](excellent_rectangle.stl)
